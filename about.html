                        <p>Hi! I’m a Computer Science graduate who started my career in the BPO industry, where I learned the value of teamwork, adaptability, and clear communication. After more than a year of helping people solve problems, I decided to take a leap back into my real passion — building software and creating digital solutions.</p>
                        <p>Now, I’m focused on growing as a backend and web developer, crafting applications that are both functional and intuitive. I love working with technologies like JavaScript, Python, Node.js, Express, and React, and I use Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code as my main tools for development. I also enjoy exploring databases like MySQL and MongoDB, and continuously improving my skills through real-world projects and learning new frameworks.</p>
                        <p>Every line of code I write is a small step toward my goal of becoming a well-rounded developer — one who builds not just for performance, but for people.</p>
